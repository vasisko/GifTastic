# GifTastic
Source for animated gifs, powered by Giphy.

## The Challenge:  
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the users choice: call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML.

## To use: 
Select a button to view animated gifs that pertain to that topic.
Or - enter a keyword/phrase into the textbox to add a button with your desired topic that you can select.

The results are returned on the page below the buttons, displaying up to 10 images along with the image's rating (g or pg ).

To animate gifs:  click on gif to start animation (continuing as infinite loop) and click to stop.
